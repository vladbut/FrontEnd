1. WAF which returns a matrix n rows and m columns containing random numbers between 1 and 100
2. WAF with n and m (rows and columns) as  parameters and returns an array with sum of numbers from every column from the generated matrix (use random numbers)
1,2,3
4,5,6
=====
5,7,9  --this should be the result

3. same as 2 but returns the sum of numbers from every line

4. same as 2 but (n===m - si is a sware matrix) returns the sum of numbers UNDER the main diagonal
2,3,4,5
1,2,3,4
5,6,7,8
9,1,3,2
--> resut should be: 2 + 3+4 + 1 +2 + 5 = 15

5. WAF which returns the minimum number from a matrix

6. WAF which returns an array from a matrix representing all the matrix numbers in a clock direction
1,2,3
8,9,4
7,6,5
will return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

7. WAF WR the sum of numbers of every min number from every line
.using the matrix from ex 6, the result is: 1 + 4 + 5 = 10

8. WAF witn n and m as matrix rows and columns and returns an array with the sum of numbers from every diagonal
. using matrix from 6 ==> [7, 8+ 6 = 14, 1+9+5 = 15, 2+4 = 6, 3]

9.fill an array with random numbers and create a matrix with the numbers from array

10. create the multiplication numbers matrix (10X10)
