1. WAF WR 6 random numbers out of 49
 hint: create an array of objects {number: i, code: random string}. for random string use guid. (take a look over javascript guid function). sort the array by code and take first 6

2. simulate a 6/49 game. you have the winning 6 numbers and n tickets. return the tickets which has 1 winning number, 2 , .... 6
hint: you can use :
winningTickets = {};
winningTickets[1] = []; ... winningTickets[6] = [];


3. Create a chat. you have one chat room with many users. 
- when a user send a message to the chat, every user receive that message. 
- when a user enters into the room it will receive the existing messages

hint: use the same approach as descibed with closure at the store example

4. you have an array; please return all pairs of numbers with sum equal n
ex: [1,3,2,6, 5], 7 ==> [[1,6],[2,5]]


5. please design a matrix of n/n numbers containing random numbers between (0, n)
hint: an array is []
a matrix is [[], [], []] ...
this means that arr = []; and after that arr[0] = []; and so on

6. return the sum of numbers

7. return the sum of all diagonal numbers

8. return the sum of numbers for every column

9. WAF WR the "determinantul" :)

10. WAF which store the selected days of the week.
hint: you can use: ['monday', 'tuesday' , ...] or assign to every day a value and store as [0, 1], etc OR use bit wise: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 ... to verify is checked you can use (value & 2 ('tuesday') )  === 2
