1. WAF wr the distinct elements from an array
2. implement a navigation back and forth mechanism
 you have an array; ypur function "next" and "previous" willl go next one step and back one step
 on next, if index is the last one, it will be set to 0 

3. WAF which writes to the console the current date, after 2 seconds
4. WAF which writes to the console the current date, after x seconds
5.having an array of nummbers, print the current date to the console after x seconds
[1,5,6], it will print the date after 1 and after that after 5 and after that after 6 sec
6. implement double click. WAF WHICH prints to the console "double click" in case the function was triggered twice in a specific iterval
7. count haw many calls of a function has been made in a specific interval

8.WAF which returns the sum of elements from an array. (recursively)
9. WAF which calculate the n!   --recursion


10. WAF which returns the longest word from a proposition. use regular expression; we didn't learn but do a search









Keep it for later. WAF to determine if a epression is correctly written; 

(2+3)-5) is bad
((2+3)-5) is bad
(2+3))-5 is bad
((2+4)-(3*(7-9))) is good
